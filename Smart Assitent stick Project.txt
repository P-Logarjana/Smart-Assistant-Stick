------------SMART-ASSISTENT-STICK------------------

***According to global research, around 40 million people worldwide are completely blind,
while another 250 million suffer from some form of visual impairment. Many of them rely on traditional white canes, 
which have limitations, particularly in unfamiliar environments.

***This project aims to enhance mobility and independence for visually impaired individuals by developing a Smart Assistant Stick 
using Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, and a buzzer for real-time obstacle detection. The stick provides immediate audible and vibration feedback to 
assist users in avoiding obstacles and holes.
